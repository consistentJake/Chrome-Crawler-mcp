We are dedicated to identifying emerging abuse trends, analyzing risks, and working with our internal and external partners to implement effective mitigation strategies to protect against misuse. Our efforts contribute to OpenAI's overarching goal of developing AI that benefits humanity.\nThe Strategic Intelligence & Analysis (SIA) team provides safety intelligence for OpenAI’s products by monitoring, analyzing, and forecasting real-world abuse, geopolitical risks, and strategic threats. Our work informs safety mitigations, product decisions, and partnerships, ensuring OpenAI’s tools are deployed securely and responsibly across critical sectors.",
        "about_the_role": "We are looking for an AI social risk analyst to sit at the frontline of a new category of challenges: AI-enabled social experiences. As AI systems like Sora and advanced chat models become part of messaging, group conversations, creator tools, and branded experiences, new forms of challenges could emerge in human–AI–human interactions.\nIn this role, you will own the analytical view of safety and abuse risks in AI-social environments: Sora content and sharing, group chats, messaging, and AI-assisted brand and creator experiences. You will spot early warning signs, pull threads on potentially concerning behavior, and turn weak signals into clear, prioritized risk calls. Your work will guide mitigations that keep users, brands, and communities safe while allowing productive, creative uses of these tools to thrive.\nIn this role, you will\nMap and prioritize the AI-social risk landscape\nBuild and continuously refine a clear picture of how AI is used in social-like products (e.g., Sora-powered clips, group chats, messaging assistants, creator tools).\nDesign and maintain harm taxonomies tailored to AI-mediated communication (e.g., synthetic harassment, coordinated AI-assisted brigading, synthetic identity/brand misuse, reputational and intimate harms).\nMaintain a risk register and prioritization framework that surfaces the top issues by severity, prevalence, exposure, and trajectory.\nDetect and deep dive into emerging abuse patterns\nPartner with investigations, operations, and product teams to surface new patterns of misuse across Sora, chats, and partner integrations.\nRun structured deep dives on incidents, from synthetic impersonation and scams to targeted harassment or coordinated influence using AI-generated media.\nConnect individual incidents into system-level stories about actors, incentives, product design weaknesses, and cross-product spillover.\nTurn analysis into actionable risk intelligence\nTranslate findings into clear, ranked risk lists and concrete proposals for mitigations that product, safety, and policy teams can execute on.\nCollaborate with Safety Systems, Integrity, and Product to scope solutions such as classification improvements, UX guardrails, friction, enforcement flows, and detection signals.\nTrack whether mitigation work is landing: follow key indicators, pressure-test assumptions, and push for course corrections when the data demands it.\nBuild early warning and measurement capabilities\nHelp define the core metrics and signals that indicate whether AI-social environments are safe (e.g., key harm prevalence, severity distributions, escalation rates, brand safety issues).\nWork with data science and visualization colleagues to shape monitoring views and dashboards that highlight leading indicators and unusual changes in user behavior or abuse patterns.\nPropose targeted probes, structured reviews, and experiments that surface new risk modes around major launches and feature changes.\nProvide strategic analysis and future-looking perspectives\nProduce concise, decision-ready briefs on AI-social risks for leadership, safety forums, and partner teams.\nRun scenario analyses that explore how AI-social harms might evolve over the next 6–24 months (e.g., how attackers might adapt to Sora, how group chats could be used for coordination, likely pressure points for brands and public figures).\nBenchmark OpenAI’s AI-social risk profile and mitigations against external incidents and other platforms, highlighting gaps, strengths, and opportunities.\nShape safety readiness for social-like AI products\nContribute to product readiness and launch reviews by laying out expected abuse modes, risk tradeoffs, and monitoring/response plans.\nTurn risk insights into practical guidance for internal teams (product, marketing, partnerships, comms) and, where appropriate, external partners using OpenAI technologies in social and brand contexts.\nDevelop reusable frameworks, playbooks, FAQs, and briefing materials that make it easier for the broader organization to understand AI-social risks and respond consistently.",

With a dual mandate to accelerate researchers and enable frontier scale, we’re building a unified, modular runtime that meets researchers where they are and moves with them up the scaling curve.\nOur work focuses on three pillars: high-performance, asynchronous, zero-copy tensor and optimizer-state-aware data movement; performant, high-uptime, fault-tolerant training frameworks (training loop, state management, resilient checkpointing, deterministic orchestration, and observability); and distributed process management for long-lived, job-specific and user-provided processes.\nWe integrate proven large-scale capabilities into a composable, developer-facing runtime so teams can iterate quickly and run reliably at any scale, partnering closely with model-stack, research, and platform teams.
