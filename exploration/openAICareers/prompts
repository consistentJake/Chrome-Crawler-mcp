can you move extract_job_content function out of '/home/zhenkai/personal/Projects/WebAgent/exploration/openAICareers/scrape_all_jobs.py' and put into a utils.py. then update it to extract the location correctly.        
what and how to fix:
1. for example take /home/zhenkai/personal/Projects/WebAgent/exploration/openAICareers/jobs/software-engineer-chatgpt-for-work.html as example input, 
  given the content in the html, we can find this part:

  ```
  Software Engineer, ChatGPT for Work</h2><div class="mt-sm"><p class="col-span-12 text-primary-100 @md:col-span-8 @md:col-start-3 text-balance">Applied AI Engineering - Seattle and San Francisco</p></div></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-center"><a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openai/d8cbc2b8-9530-433b-ba18-6622bb79990e/application" 
  ```

  then `Software Engineer, ChatGPT for Work` is the title, `Seattle`,`San Francisco` are the two locations. https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openai/d8cbc2b8-9530-433b-ba18-6622bb79990e/application is the application link.

2.  why we initially can't correclty get the Responsibilities and Qualifications session in parsing html like exploration/openAICareers/jobs/full-stack-swe-data-acquisition-foundations.html
3. write a new script so that we can reprocess the htmls under exploration/openAICareers/jobs/ folders, and regenerated the exploration/openAICareers/all_jobs_extracted.json files.
4. update the exploration/openAICareers/job_filter.ipynb, the loading of the jobs after filter are taking a lots of time for GUI, debug why that happen and fix. 
5. in the ipynb, update the filter to include location and team accordingly. 
6. update the ipynb's skill filter list. here is the new list :exploration/openAICareers/extract_skill_lists.md
